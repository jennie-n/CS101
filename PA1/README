README lists all files being submitted.

List.java is a List ADT that is a doubly linked list. Each node of the list contains an int (the data) and 2 Node references. The List class contains three specific Nodes (front, back, cursor), the length of the list, and the index of the cursor. When the cursor is undefined, its index is -1.

ListClient.java is a test client for the List ADT & was provided to us.

Lex.java is a client module that takes 2 command line arguments (the input and output files, respectively) and implements the List ADT to sort the elements of an input array indirectly. 

Makefile has a make command that compiles all .java files in the current directory, creates an executable jar file named Lex, and includes a clean utility that removes Lex and any associated .class files.
